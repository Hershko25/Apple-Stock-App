I took on myself the challenge of building a replica of the Apple Stock app as a WEB APP that fits any smartphone as well as a computer. 📈🍏🍎

By using react js, CSS, and HTML I was able to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. 👨‍💻🖱💻


The web app is based on yahoo finance API and the chart is built with Recharts a composable charting library built on React components.📊📉
